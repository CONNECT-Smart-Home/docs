# RS485 Interface (Modbus RTU)

One-channel RS485 interface extention

<PrintPage> </PrintPage>

### üíé Possibilities
- Integration any RS485 devices up to 32 per block
- Supported MODBUS RTU
- Supported any Binary or ASCII RS485 protocols
- Isolated RS485 interface

## ‚ùì Description
RS485 interface block intended for integration third-party RS485 devices in automated control systems in the fields of industry, housing and communal services and household services.

### üîß Technical data
| General |
|-|-|
| Design | Universal housing for mounting on a DIN rail (width 2 din) |
| Degree of protection housing | IP20|
| Supply voltage | 10‚Ä¶25 VDC (12 or 24 V nominal)|
| Power consumption, no more | 2.5 W |
| Number of RS485 interfaces | 1 |
| Isolated interface | Yes |
| Max number of RS485 devices | 32 |

| Interfaces | |
|-|-|
|USB | Service connection|
|RS485** | YoctoBUS protocol |
|Isolated RS485 | Modbus RTU or Binary or ASCII |
|Ethernet**| IEEE 802.3 10/100BASE-T (http, UDP)|
|WiFi**| IEEE 802.11 (http, UDP) |
** Depending on unit configuration.

:::tip
- For `YoctoBUS` blocks: the default exchange protocol type is `YoctoBUS`, initial configuration is not required.
- For `YoctoLAN` units: when connecting to the network via `Ethernet`, initial configuration is not required, when connected via WiFi, you must set the **SSID and Password** using the `CONNECT Configurator` software.
:::

:::note
To integrate the unit into third-party systems, the protocol and RS485 exchange rate, as well as network settings, are set through the free, cross-platform `CONNECT Configurator` software.

:::note
It is recommended to configure the RS485 parameters using the CONNECT Configurator software

**YoctoBUS mode**

:::info
`YoctoBUS` protocol commands are in text form.

- Writing an ASCII string to external RS485 (RS485 ASCII mode):
```
I_aaa_setRS_R1A_vvvvv
``` 
- Writing HEX value to external RS485 (RS485 HEX mode):
```
I_aaa_setRS_R1H_vvvvv
``` 

- Reading last ASCII string from external RS485 (RS485 ASCII mode):
```
I_aaa_stateRS_R1A_vvvvv
``` 
- Reading last HEX value from external RS485 (RS485 HEX mode):
```
I_aaa_stateRS_R1H_vvvvv
``` 

- Response when an ASCII string is received from external RS485 (RS485 ASCII mode):
```
A_aaa_stateRS_R1A_vvvvv
```
- Response when HEX value is received from external RS485 (RS485 HEX mode):
```
A_aaa_stateRS_R1H_vvvvv
``` 

**aaa** - bus block address

**vvvvv** - HEX value / ASCII string
