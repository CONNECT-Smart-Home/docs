Single-channel relay block

<PrintPage> </PrintPage>

### üíé Possibilities
- Contacts NC, COM, NO (changeover relay)
- Manage loads by type Enable/Disable
- Control of lighting, ventilation, heaters and other loads
- Management of low-current devices with dry contact inputs

## ‚ùì Description
Relay block R1 is intended for switching signals and elements of electrical circuits in automated control systems for lighting, power distribution equipment, ventilation systems, climate and other electrical loads, in the fields of industry, housing and communal services and household services.

### üîß Technical data
| General |
|-|-|
| Design | Universal housing for mounting on a DIN rail (width 2 din) |
| Degree of protection housing | IP20|
| Supply voltage | 18‚Ä¶25 VDC (24 V nominal)|
| Power consumption, no more | 2.5 W relays off; <br/> 2.9 W relays on;|
| Number of relay outputs | 1 (normally open, normally closed state)|
| Maximum switching voltage | 30 VDC; <br/> 230 VAC;|
| Maximum switching current | 16 A |

| Interfaces | |
|-|-|
|USB | Service connection|
|RS485** | YoctoBUS or Modbus RTU |
|Ethernet**| IEEE 802.3 10/100BASE-T (http, UDP)|
|WiFi**| IEEE 802.11 (http, UDP) |
** Depending on unit configuration.

:::tip
- For `YoctoBUS` blocks: the default exchange protocol type is `YoctoBUS`, initial configuration is not required.
- For `YoctoLAN` units: when connecting to the network via `Ethernet`, initial configuration is not required, when connected via WiFi, you must set the **SSID and Password** using the `CONNECT Configurator` software.
:::

:::note
To integrate the unit into third-party systems, the protocol and RS485 exchange rate, as well as network settings, are set through the free, cross-platform `CONNECT Configurator` software.

**General block control registers**

The block is controlled by setting and reading the values of the block registers.

| Register ID | Register description | Write | Read | Range of values |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Relay status 1 | + | + | 0, 1 |

RS485 setting registers.

| Register ID | Register description | Write | Read | Range of values |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 203** | BaudRate RS485 | + | + | 3-9 |
| 206 | Id of the Modbus block | + | + | 1-247 |

** Correspondence of RS485 speed and value in register 203:

| Value | Speed, baud/s |
|-|-|
|3| 4800|
|4| 9600|
|5| 19200|
|6| 38400|
|7| 57600|
|8| 74880|
|9| 115200|

:::note
It is recommended to configure the RS485 parameters using the CONNECT Configurator software
:::

**ModbusRTU mode**

The unit supports standard exchange via the ModbusRTU protocol.

- **Reading** the state of the register is carried out by the command `3`.
- **Record** of value in the register is carried out by the command `6`.

**YoctoBUS mode**

:::info
`YoctoBUS` protocol commands are in text form.

- Writing a value to a register:
```
I_aaa_set_rrr_vvvvv
``` 
- Register value request:
```
I_aaa_state_rrr
```
- Block response to write value:
```
O_aaa_set_rrr_vvvvv
```
- Block response to a value request:
```
O_aaa_state_rrr_vvvvv
``` 

**aaa** - bus block address

**rrr** - register number

**vvvvv** - register value
:::

- **Read register value**

An example of requesting state 5 of a block register (block addres is 15):

```
I_15_state_5
/or/
I_015_state_00005
```

An example of block response with value 1 in register 5:
```
O_015_state_005_00001
```

- **Write value to register**

An example of setting the value 0 to register 16 (block id is 11):
```
I_11_set_16_0
/or/
I_011_set_016_00000
```

An example of a block response to setting the value 0 in register 16:
```
O_011_set_016_00000
```

Block outputs are controlled by sending an HTTP GET request.

:::note
The network parameters of the unit are configured using the CONNECT Configurator software
:::

- The structure of HTTP `GET` requests for writing a value to a register

|Header |Ip address of the block| Command | Separator |Register number | Separator | Value|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|http:// |192.168.130.150| /set| _ |13| _| 1|
In the example shown, `http://192.168.150.150/set_13_1` is set to "1" in block register 13.

- Structure of HTTP `GET` requests for reading block register value

|Header |Ip address of the block| Command | Separator |Register number |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|http:// |192.168.130.150| /state |_ |13|
In the example shown `http://192.168.130.150/state_13`, the block register value 13 is requested.

**The structure of the block response page to a `GET` request**

The body of the page (between the `<body>` tags) contains:
```
Control=‚Ä≥13‚Ä≥ Value=‚Ä≥1‚Ä≥
```
In the example shown, the block returned an HTML page with the text content `Control=‚Ä≥13‚Ä≥ Value=‚Ä≥1‚Ä≥`, which means that register 13 of the block is set to '1'.
