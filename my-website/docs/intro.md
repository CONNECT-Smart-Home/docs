## What is CONNECT

CONNECT is the professional automation system which builds on the main controller and different peripheral devices (actuators and sensors) like:
- Dimmers
- LED drivers
- Interfaces
- Analog and digital inputs
- Relays
- Environment sensors
- Security sensors
- Wall switches and pannels

...and other blocks, devices and functional units.


### Main features

CONNECT is the widely scalable system which allows to connect **not only our own** peripheral blocks but a lot of **third-part devices** and services.

It's a new approach in home automation bored on a peak of IoT evolution, and it allows to **unite different devices and services** from different vendors with different interfaces and APIs in the **single automation system**.


## Software

Our software is based on Node-RED. It is event-driven, **low-code**, **user-friendly** visual programming and it's easy to understand both for **IT specialists** and for **electricians**. 

Our **free apps** and **free WEB Interfase** are automatically synchronized with the system you are configuring. By the way you can download apps from Google Play or App store and also try our demo WEB UI.
