# Introducing CONNECT

Let's discover **CONNECT** Smart Home.

## üìÉ What is CONNECT

**CONNECT** is the professional automation system which builds on the [main controller Y1](/docs/blocks/y1) and different peripheral devices (actuators and sensors) like:
- Dimmers [DT1](/docs/blocks/dt1)
- LED drivers [W4](/docs/blocks/w4)
- Interfaces [RS485](/docs/blocks/rs485), [DMX](/docs/blocks/dmx)
- Analog and digital inputs [DI4](/docs/blocks/di4), [DI4 OC](/docs/blocks/di4oc)
- Relays [R1](/docs/blocks/r1), [R8](/docs/blocks/r8)
- Environment sensors
- Security sensors
- Wall switches and pannels

...and other blocks, devices and functional units.

## ü©∂ Advantages of CONNECT

**CONNECT** is the widely scalable system which allows to connect **not only our own** peripheral blocks but a lot of **third-part devices** and services.

It's a new approach in home automation was born on a peak of IoT evolution, and it allows to **unite different devices and services** from different vendors with different interfaces and APIs in the **single automation system**.


## üíª Software

Our software is based on Node-RED. It is event-driven, **low-code**, **user-friendly** visual programming and it's easy to understand both for **IT specialists** and for **electricians**. 

Our **free apps** and **free WEB Interfase** are automatically synchronized with the system you are configuring.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why CONNECT is secure, fast and reliable

The next feature of **CONNECT** automation system is **no clouds**. 
All critical data and automation algorithms are stored on the **local** main controller. 

Cloud is used **only** for remote encrypted security connections, for example from smartphone via mobile network. 

So you can be sure that your **CONNECT** Smart Home system is **secure, fast and reliable**, and sudden Internet link loss will not be a problem.

## üß† Rethinking Smart Home is our slogan

We always improve our system, make it more usability, more compact, more technological. It's possible only through communication with our users and we really grateful for your feedbacks. 

Together we are building a **new mindset** in the home automation field.
